Quick Overview
---

This page is designed with simplicity in mind, so its build nearly on HTML & CSS only. This page is build up from scratch without any toolbox or bootstrap.
A few simple Java Script lines are used for creating a "hamburger" styled side menu inspired by some work I've seen from [Adrian Gyuricska](https://github.com/AdrianGyuricska).
